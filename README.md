SupaMind
========

SupaMind allows you to create a mindmap with contents which can be a set of pictures or text for each node. You can save a mindmap as PNG (by right clicking on it) or as a JSON file which you can reuse on Supamind site to visualize it or edit it again. 

Tips
----
- In order to add contents, you have to edit the node (double-click on it in Edit mode) and in the content area you put some text and/or link to a picture. Each line of your input is considered as a content.
- In order to add picture to a node, follow the procedure previously described to add a content and put "img:linkToThisImage" in the content area.
- The order of your contents in the contents area is important and is taking in account when you reedit or visualize the node.

Features coming in the next update of the site 
----------------------------------------------
